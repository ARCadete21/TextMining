### Project Description

In the this project, our objective is to harness the power of text mining techniques to delve into the emotional essence of various music genres. This text mining endeavor encompasses two primary tasks: genre identification and sentiment analysis. The project revolves around training a machine learning model on a comprehensive dataset containing song lyrics and corresponding genres, aiming to accurately predict the genre of a song based on its lyrical content. Additionally, we embark on a sentiment analysis journey, exploring the emotional undertones within song lyrics to decipher the diverse emotional landscape across different genres. Open-ended questions guide this segment, such as discerning predominant sentiments in specific musical genres and investigating potential changes in these sentiments over time. Ultimately, our project aims to shed light on the intricate relationship between lyrics, emotions, and music genres, unraveling the profound sentiments embedded in the rhythms of diverse musical compositions.

#### Objectives:
1. Genre Identification:
- Build a classification model to predict the genre of a song based on its lyrics.
- Utilize machine learning techniques and a dataset containing song lyrics and corresponding genres.

2. Sentiment Analysis:
- Explore emotional undertones within song lyrics to decipher the emotional essence of each genre.
- Derive sentiment ratings from lyrics and investigate notable sentiment differences within and across genres.
- Formulate and answer open-ended questions, such as changes in sentiments over the years and the impact of sentiment on genre popularity.

#### Data Description
The [Genius Lyrics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information/data) contains public user and song information from the music lyric annotation website [genius](https://genius.com/). It includes the basic information about a song: title, artists, lyrics and genre.

The original dataset has a total of 5 million songs. However, in this project, less than 5% were used.
